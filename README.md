# üöÄ Spring Boot Microservices Project

Welcome to my Spring Boot Microservices project! This project demonstrates the complete implementation of a microservices architecture using **Spring Boot** and **Spring Cloud**. Dive in to explore how microservices solve the challenges of monolithic architecture and learn how they communicate, scale, and provide resilience.

## üîó **Section 3 - Microservice Communication**
- Overview of Microservice Communication Methods
- Communication Using **RestTemplate**
- Communication Using **WebClient**
- Communication Using **Spring Cloud OpenFeign**

1. RestTemplate:
   Traditional way to make HTTP requests.
   Blocking and simple, but deprecated in Spring 5+.

2. WebClient:
   Modern, flexible, supports both blocking and non-blocking calls.
   Ideal for reactive systems and efficient communication.
   WebClient supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications

3. Spring OpenFeign:
   Declarative REST client for easy service-to-service calls.
   Integrates with service discovery and load balancing.

# Asynchronous Communication
- Message Brokers: Services use message brokers like RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or ActiveMQ for event-driven, asynchronous communication.
- Spring Cloud Stream: Provides integration with messaging platforms to handle communication using event streams.
