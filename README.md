Spring Boot Microservices Communication

Synchronous Communication in Spring Boot

In microservices, synchronous communication occurs when one service calls another and waits for a response. Spring Boot offers three tools for this:

1. RestTemplate:

Traditional way to make HTTP requests.
Blocking and simple, but deprecated in Spring 5+.

2. WebClient:

Modern, flexible, supports both blocking and non-blocking calls.
Ideal for reactive systems and efficient communication.
WebClient supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications


3. Spring OpenFeign:

Declarative REST client for easy service-to-service calls.
Integrates with service discovery and load balancing.


Asynchronous Communication

  Message Brokers: Services use message brokers like RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or ActiveMQ for event-driven, asynchronous communication.
  
  Spring Cloud Stream: Provides integration with messaging platforms to handle communication using event streams.
